# CODES 
Python code for dot product of two vectors: 
```
def dot_product(vector1, vector2):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(vector1)):
        result += vector1[i] * vector2[i]
    return result

vector1 = [1, 2, 3]
vector2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(vector1, vector2)
print("Dot product:", result)

```

# MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS
